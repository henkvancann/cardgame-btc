Welcome to the cardgame Bitcoin Misconceptions!

Cardgame instances as you see them on the web comprise of roughly two parts: the engine (which is in this repo) and the implementation, or the `card stack` or `card set`.

> This is the **Misconceptions about bitcoin** repository!

## What is Cardgame Bitcoin Misconceptions?
See the [About](https://blockchainbird.com/t/btc/about) page on the tool.

## References fore and against!
The Card game acknowledges, and is acknowledged by, several respected criticasters and respected **experts** in the bitcoin community and outside.

* Bitcoin wiki
* Elaine Ou
* Eric Voskuil
* Aaron van Wierdum
* Andreas Antonopoulos
* Parker Lewis
* Christopher Allan
* and many others.

We integrated their contributions in the _More_-button of cards: response articles, comments and text, their fundamental thesis and instruction videos.

Of course we respect **criticasters** too, at the minimum for their contribution to the list of Misconceptions, ready to answer:

1. Peter Schiff
2. Nouriel Roubini
3. Warren Buffet
4. Charles Munger 
5. Jack Ma
6. Robert Shiller
7. Jamie Dimon

and many others.

Some peopple might never be able to change their minds, because of the extreme stands taken. Nevertheless we are thankful for their sacrifice of reputation (see how history proofs them right or wrong [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/bitcoin-bulls-bears/) ). 

With their unceasing list of recognisable statements, we can more efficiently help you and the rest of the world to make up your mind. 

## What's the drive, what's the use?
Bitcoin Misconceptions is a tool that helps to _get it right_ about `bitcoin` on the internet. Mission Impossible, no?\
Maybe, but we offer:
- cards with layers, pictures, text, sound, videos, podcasts, read more links etc.
- Twitter streams: actual tweets in the world about your _search keys_, eg. "_bitcoin_" and "_criminal_"
- quizzes
- Scores, calculates scores based on the actual interaction about a card stack in social media
- About page for references, howtos, etc.

## Other implementations of the cardgame engine

Here are some live versions of other card sets based on and maybe even running on the same engine:
* [Blockchain bullshit buster](https://blockchainbird.com/t/bcb/)
* [Misconception about self sovereign identity](https://blockchainbird.com/t/id/)

## What is it for?
Education, validation and self conviction.

## What can you do with card stacks?
A. You can easily '_copy_' the fixed URL's (permalinks) and use '_paste_' in the most common social media to give response to people with a comment.

B. If you've received a Card, someone sent you a message....  Consider to read the card, and if you like Educate and Convince yourself of the content.

C. Enjoy the responses you get and the slow game of receiving scores for social media engagement

## Who owns this tool? 
No one and everyone at the same time: Open source, public*, free, no hidden agendas...

## About the creators and other roles
A card stack maintainer will look for experts in the field who acknowledge the content. These will be  respected criticasters and respected **experts** in the Bitcoin community and/or outside.

A cardgame creator will integrate expert contributions in the _More_-button of cards: response articles, comments and text, their fundamental thesis and instruction videos.

In certain cases a card maintainer wants to offer a balanced view in cards and also grant acknowledgements to **criticasters**, at the minimum for their contributions.

# Why a card game
Mainly to use the network-effect. Our main goal is to neutralise the misconceptions about bitcoin as smoothly as possible with the least effort needed by:<br/>
1. find the appropriate matching card(s) to the _Prejudice_, the _misconception_, the _wrong-doing_, the _bullshit_ if you like 
2. providing response in social media: information and education in distinct fashions: direct, deeply informative, video, asking counter questions, offering a quiz, further reading, etc.
3. offering a fixed URL and shortened URL to be able to copy and paste to give access to the information
4. measure success
5. save time

## The rules and scores of the game
See - [Rules and Scores](rules-game-scores.md) of the game.

## How to use the cards
Have a look at an example stack of cards:\
Go to https://blockchainbird.com/t/btc/, use the Tweet stream to find an appealing tweet with a misconception radiating from it, find the right card to answer (or whole category of cards), copy URL, and *"step forward"* by _pasting_ the copied URL in the tweet-response of the original tweet from the Tweet-stream. Briefly:
> Find a tweet - Select a card - Reply with card
