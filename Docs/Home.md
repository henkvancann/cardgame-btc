Welcome to the cardgame Engine!

Cardgame instances as you see them on the web comprise of roughly two parts: the engine (which is in this repo) and the implementation, or the `card stack` or `card set`
To illustrate the characteristics and benefits of the engine here, we will use: **Misconceptions about bitcoin** as an example.

> Important:  One cardgame engine can run multiple subjects in sets.

## What is Cardgame engine?
It is a tool that helps to _get it right_ on the internet. Mission Impossible, no?\
Maybe, but we offer an engine that lets you focus on a specific topic with a specific usergroup. The engine offers these features:
- cards with layers, pictures, text, sound, videos, podcasts, read more links etc.
- Twitter streams: actual tweets in the world about your _search keys_, eg. "_bitcoin_" and "_criminal_"
- quizzes
- Scores, calculates scores based on the actual interaction about a card stack in social media
- About page for references, howtos, etc.

Technically speaking it's github repo that you can generate a SPA site with. The site is responsive, so it works on deskop computers, laptops and mobile phones in the most used browsers. The site fills itself with content from a Google Sheet attached to it via JSON.

# Bitcoin Misconceptions Example implementation

## Functioning and recognition of various implementations of the engine
Topics have distinctive colors in the tool and the content is focussed on different topics. Each implementation can have feature put on or off. But the rest is the same for all card-stacks.\
Here are some live versions of the cardsets:
* [Bitcoin misconceptions](https://blockchainbird.com/t/btc/)
* [Blockchain bullshit buster](https://blockchainbird.com/t/bcb/)
* [Misconception about self sovereign identity](https://blockchainbird.com/t/id/)

## What is it for?
Education, validation and self conviction.

## What can you do with card stacks?
A. You can easily '_copy_' the fixed URL's (permalinks) and use '_paste_' in the most common social media to give response to people with a comment.

B. If you've received a Card, someone sent you a message....  Consider to read the card, and if you like Educate and Convince yourself of the content.

C. Enjoy the responses you get and the slow game of receiving scores for social media engagement

## Who owns this tool? 
No one and everyone at the same time: Open source, public*, free, no hidden agendas...

## Related to what?
A Cardgame engine is a white label open source engine in the back office. The card stack serves a certain purpose around a topic, e.g. "fight bitcoin prejudice" or "answers to bitcoin misconceptions" Dependent of topic, goal, approach, a card stack maintainer will look for experts in the field who acknowledge the content. These will be  respected criticasters and respected **experts** in a certain community (e.g. the bitcoin community) and/or outside.


A cardgame creator will integrate their contributions in the _More_-button of cards: response articles, comments and text, their fundamental thesis and instruction videos.

In certain cases a card maintainer wants to offer a balanced view in cards and also grant acknowledgements to **criticasters**, at the minimum for their contributions.

# Why a card game
Mainly to use the network-effect. Our main goal is to neutralise the misconceptions about bitcoin as smoothly as possible with the least effort needed by:<br/>
1. find the appropriate matching card(s) to the _Prejudice_, the _misconception_, the _wrong-doing_, the _bullshit_ if you like 
2. providing response in social media: information and education in distinct fashions: direct, deeply informative, video, asking counter questions, offering a quiz, further reading, etc.
3. offering a fixed URL and shortened URL to be able to copy and paste to give access to the information
4. measure success
5. save time

## The rules and scores of the game
See - [Rules and Scores](rules-game-scores.md) of the game.

## How to use the cards
Have a look at an example stack of cards:\
Go to https://blockchainbird.com/t/btc/, use the Tweet stream to find an appealing tweet with a misconception radiating from it, find the right card to answer (or whole category of cards), copy URL, and *"step forward"* by _pasting_ the copied URL in the tweet-response of the original tweet from the Tweet-stream. Briefly:
> Find a tweet - Select a card - Reply with card
